## :wave: Description: 
Whether you need to manage daily routines, plan projects, or keep track of personal goals, Taskinator is here to simplify the process and boost productivity!

Taskinator is a user-friendly Kanban Board application designed to assist with task management and organization. Built using plain JavaScript, this application empowers users to create, manage, and track their tasks effortlessly. Taskinator allows users to input task details and easily convert them into actionable items on the board. Tasks can be categorized into different columns, such as "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Completed," enabling users to visualize their progress and prioritize their work effectively.

This application was the first time I worked with Web-APIs and was a part of my course at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. However feeling the need to go further and proudly call this app my own, I devoted time into finishing this project some three years later. Additionally I have improved upon the application by adding visual features to enhance the overall quality of the app. On that note, the base bootcamp project ended at commit 6fa75d8647d4c6c29d0c28ec3120ba265da444c2, anything after are the ammendments that I personally made. My main changes mostly focused on fixing the CSS layout and adding new visual changes for a more personalized Taskinator. Also I adjusted Taskinator's performance for mobile devices. 

Big thanks to the UCLA Coding Bootcamp for their direction and thank YOU for checking Taskinator out - I hope you enjoy it and happy coding!
